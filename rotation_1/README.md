# Rotation 1
 This repository contains a collection of code written in MATLAB during my first rotation. The goal is to test null models of centroid distribution and then apply these to analysis of fly NMJ imaging.
 
 ## null_model_verification.m
 This program tests two null models of centroid distribution and uses the function hexagonal_null.m to create hexagonal lattices of centroids according to set densities.
